### Referrences

This repository draws upon and adapts existing implementations from the following research works:

#### **Crystal Twin**
Certain classes and functions in this repository are directly based on code from the Crystal Twin paper
- `Normalizer`
- `GaussianDistance`
- `AtomInitializer`
- `AtomCustomJSONInitializer`
- `_save_config_file`

#### **Nested Line Graph (NLG)**
The function in `JSON_TO_NX/representation_function.py` is a heavily adapted version of the one used to preprocess crystal structures in the original Nested Line Graph paper
