Some of the function is this work is based on implementations from the crystal twin paper and the nested line graph paper, of which this paper is primary inspired.


Crystal twin: 

class Normalizer # directly use
class GaussianDistance # directly use
class AtomInitializer # directly use
class AtomCustomJSONInitializer # directly use
func _save_config_file # directly use

nested line graph

in JSON_TO_NX/representation_function.py 
- function is a heavy adapted version of the one used to preprocess the crystal from the original paper.
